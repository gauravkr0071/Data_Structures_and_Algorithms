Actually, the problem is the same as "Given a collection of intervals, find the maximum number of intervals that are non-overlapping." (the classic Greedy problem: Interval Scheduling). With the solution to that problem, guess how do we get the minimum number of intervals to remove? : )

Sorting Interval.end in ascending order is O(nlogn), then traverse intervals array to get the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals is O(n). Total is O(nlogn).
```cpp
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(Interval[] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length == 0)  return 0;

        Arrays.sort(intervals, new myComparator());
        int end = intervals[0].end;
        int count = 1;        

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i].start >= end) {
                end = intervals[i].end;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return intervals.length - count;
    }
    
    class myComparator implements Comparator<Interval> {
        public int compare(Interval a, Interval b) {
            return a.end - b.end;
        }
    }
```
