- [Pepcoding question link](https://www.pepcoding.com/resources/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-java-levelup/arrays-and-strings/wiggle-sort-1/ojquestion)
- Can you solve it in TC=O(n), SC=O(1)

```md
1. Given an unsorted array 'arr'.
2. Reorder it in-place such that :  arr[0] <= arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] . . . .
3. Please sort the array in place and do not define additional arrays.
4. Allowed Time Complexity : O(n)
Input Format
Input: [3, 5, 2, 1, 6, 4]
Output Format
Output: [1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]
```
