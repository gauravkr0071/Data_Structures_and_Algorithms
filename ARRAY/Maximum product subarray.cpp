/*
152. Maximum Product Subarray
Medium
Given an integer array nums, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.
It is guaranteed that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

    // subarray that ends with the current number A[i]

        // multiplied by a negative makes big number smaller, small number bigger
        // so we redefine the extremums by swapping them
        if (A[i] < 0)
            swap(imax, imin);

        // max/min product for the current number is either the current number itself
        // or the max/min by the previous number times the current one
        imax = max(A[i], imax * A[i]);
        imin = min(A[i], imin * A[i]);
