### __Merge 2 sorted Linked list__ 

### __Merge k Sorted Lists__

- [LC Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)

```md
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

 

Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
Example 2:

Input: lists = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
 

Constraints:

k == lists.length
0 <= k <= 10^4
0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4
lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
The sum of lists[i].length won't exceed 10^4
```
### __Solution__

```cpp
ListNode *mergeKLists(vector<ListNode *> &lists) {
    if(lists.empty()){
        return nullptr;
    }
    while(lists.size() > 1){
        lists.push_back(mergeTwoLists(lists[0], lists[1]));
        lists.erase(lists.begin());
        lists.erase(lists.begin());
    }
    return lists.front();
}
ListNode *mergeTwoLists(ListNode *l1, ListNode *l2) {
    if(l1 == nullptr){
        return l2;
    }
    if(l2 == nullptr){
        return l1;
    }
    if(l1->val <= l2->val){
        l1->next = mergeTwoLists(l1->next, l2);
        return l1;
    }
    else{
        l2->next = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2->next);
        return l2;
    }
}
The second function is from Merge Two Sorted Lists.

The basic idea is really simple. We can merge first two lists
and then push it back. Keep doing this until there is only one 
list left in vector. Actually, we can regard this as an iterative 
divide-and-conquer solution.
