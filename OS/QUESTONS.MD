echnical:
1 communication modes- simplex, duplex and half duplex

2. virtual memory depends on?
3. 
4. parameterized #define statements
5. 
6.if a array is filled with only 1 2 and 3s only, then the time complexity for best algo is?

7. queue is implemented using growing array, array is doubled at execding, worst case cost?
8. 
9. Simple programming questions, how to find the median of a singly linked list by only passing through it once.
10. 
11. Consisted of 3 rouds. The technical questions were based on Operating system and 
12. 
13. Computer Architecture. With scheduling and memory related questions. Basic C programming
14. 
15.  skills are also tested. The interview questions will be based on your projects in resume.
16.  
17.   Having many machine learning projects, I was asked to write C code for implementing convolutional network.
18.   
19.   Implement fizz buzz
20.   
21.   check whether a tree is a binary search tree
22.   

13.  OOPS concepts explain with examples,
14.  
15) Access modifiers,
16) Interface Vs Abstract class,

18) Equals and HashCode method. (Definition, not working),
19) Pointers in C++, 
20) 7Worst case complexity of Binary Tree, Balanced Binary Tree,
21) What is Linked List, Doubly Linked List & Circular Linked List,
22) Real life example of all types LL’s,
23) Complexities of all types of LL’s,
24) What is PPP Protocol,
25) What are the sampling techniques used by embedded systems?
26) What is the problem with the following code?
char[10] input;
cin >> input;

- most of them were output questions focusing on function pointers. 
- What do a section of memory addresses allocated for a struct actually look like?
-  Technical round focus is on threading, semaphores and kernel programming
-  Basics of threading, semaphores and kernel programming
-   difference between a process and a thread
-   Something to do with cache and DMA.
-   Memory related functions like malloc,calloc.
-   how C program is stored in memory and why cant we access local variables from other blocks(relating to how they are stored in memory)
-   What's the difference between pointer and reference?
