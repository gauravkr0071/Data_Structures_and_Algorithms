Online Coding Test (1.5hour): Lang: C/C++
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 1: Given a singly linked list of integer values. You must remove all the values greater than a given integer N, maintaining the integrity and order of the list. From this function you need to return a pointer to head of the updated list.

Problem 2: Given an array of integer.Your task is to find number of duplicate elements. Duplicate is defined as two or more identical elements. For example in the array [1,2,2,3,3,3], the two twos are one duplicate and so are three threes. The number of duplicate is 2.

Problem 3: Write a function to add two floating point numbers. Determine the integer floor of the sum. The floor is the trunked float value, i.e. anything after the decimal point is dropped. For instance, floor(1.1 + 3.05) = floor(4.15)=4.

Problem 4: Find no of "distinct" pairs in an array whose sum is equal to a given number.
