31- find and print all binary string with no consective 1,  can be solved with recursion. (here we can count easily)
Recusrsion approach-https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generate-binary-strings-without-consecutive-1s/
32- count all binary string with no consective 1(here we have to count only not print) so understand the difference 
Dynamic programming approach-https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-number-binary-strings-without-consecutive-1s/
Comment-Dp approach cant print all string(LOL).it is useful counting only. Same as fibonace series, for example if length= 3 have 5 strings without consecutive 1 and length 4 have 8 strings without consecutive 1 , we jhave to just add 5+8 , and give answer for 5 length string , so 5 length string have 13 strings without consective 1.
